-- Question 12:
-- Level: Very difficult
-- Topic: Uncorrelated subquery
-- Task: Create a list that shows the "average customer lifetime value" grouped by the different districts.
-- Example:
-- If there are two customers in "District 1" where one customer has a total (lifetime) spent of $1000 and the second customer has a total spent of $2000 then the "average customer lifetime spent" in this district is $1500.
